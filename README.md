# Python Django Project - POC of a costs management system for B.I.
## Goal
This project is intended to be a basic Python Django project start accelerator.
- If we have to frequently start new projects, despite Django being an amazing framework to develop web based applications, inevitably we end up repeating ourselves a lot on the initial phases, recreating a lot of boilerplate over an over.   
- And worst than that, we can find ourselves taking different approaches every time, leading to different styles, structures and choices for projects that should be look-alike in the same Team, project or company.
- So, is a good idea to have common bootstrap base.
